# Test-drive Development (TDD)

## Why TDD?

* Testable code
* Confidence in making changes
* More understanding of the code
* Directly related to code quality

## How to TDD?

A rhythmic development cycle of:

* Red: Write the test, watch it fail
* Green: Implement the function, watch it pass
* Refactor: Increase the code quality, watch it pass again
